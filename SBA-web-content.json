{"text": ["  \tThe remarkable saga of the Lara Family is the quintessential immigrant success story, one that has been played out in every community in every major city throughout America, where the smoggy air is unable to stifle the dreams that the less fortunate use to express their yearning for a better life. In this scenario, however the aspirations occur in Mexico and in East LA. Having just married Mercedes when he turned 18, Humberto Lara and his bride left the impovished town of La Cienega, Zacatecas in Mexico and headed for Los Angeles with the clothes on their backs and $50 that they were able to borrow. A cousin rented the young couple a small space in what, in effect, was a chicken coop and the Laras started the California chapter of their story.", "  \tTen years and six children later the Laras purchased their first home. At this time, Humberto was working as a butcher and looking for ways to earn additional income to support the family. These thoughts became reality as the Lara Family opened Tacos Rinconcito to sell Mexican fast food to the surrounding businesses in the City of Bell. This operation served them well but did not completely sate their entrepreneurial spirit.", "  \tAn opportunity to buy a full scale restaurant in Maywood presented itself and in 1987 Las Trancas Restaurant was born. In 1994, Humberto and Mercedes added a banquet hall business to complement the restaurant. By offering some of the Southland\u2019s best Mexican seafood entrees, Las Trancas became a local Latino legend which helped underscore the early success of the family business. In 1997, CBS Channel 2 News rated Las Trancas as one of the top 500 restaurants in Los Angeles County.", "  \tThe key to success was the familial atmosphere that transcended the presence of excellent cuisine. Las Trancas was truly a family owned business. It was obvious that Humberto and Mercedes headed the operations; however, four of the children actively work in the Restaurant or Salon, and the other siblings have a passive affinity for the business.", "  \tDemand soon exceeded seating capacity, and the Lara Family decided to expand. Plans were established to enlarge the restaurant and to add another banquet hall. This time the Laras had to reach outside of the family resources to achieve this phase of business growth. They were in need of substantial financing for expansion.", "  \tIt appeared that the Lara story would have an abbreviated ending. Several attempts to procure outside financing came to no avail. Without access to outside capital, the family business would not be able to reach its full potential and the dream would be over. It seemed that area financial institutions were reluctant to underwrite the restaurant expansion, categorizing the industry as too risky. The feasibility of acquiring a loan for another banquet also became questionable, in light of the fact that local bankers did not understand that end of the business.", "  \tThings appeared dim for the family, but because of the entrepreneurial spirit of both Humberto and Mercedes they remained firm and committed to persevere, just as they had done in the past when confronted by what appeared to be insurmountable obstacles. Their focused tenacity paid off in 1999, when they had the fortune to connect with Craig Conner, Vice President of the SBA Loan Department at Pacific Crest Bank (PCB). Craig visited the sites, acquired a solid grasp of the business operations and became well acquainted with the family behind this family-owned enterprise.", "  \tAs a result of the relationship established between Craig\u2019s Bank and Las Trancas, two SBA 7 (a) loans have been made to the Laras. In 1999 the first loan doubled the restaurant capacity and added a beautiful patio eating area. The second loan financed the second location for the banquet business.", "  \tAs an epilog, today, Humberto and Mercedes Lara are the proud owners of a thriving enterprise that provides security for the entire family, and has created three dozen jobs within the local community. In honor of their accomplishments, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) today selected Humberto and Mercedes Lara and Las Trancas Restaurant as winners of the Family Owned Business Award.

Roosevelt, and was staffed by some of Roosevelt's most capable and dedicated workers.", " Concern for small business intensified during World War II, when large industries beefed up production to accommodate wartime defense contracts and smaller businesses were left unable to compete. To help small business participate in war production and give them financial viability, Congress created the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) in 1942. The SWPC provided direct loans to private entrepreneurs, encouraged large financial institutions to make credit available to small enterprises, and advocated small business interests to federal procurement agencies and big businesses.", " The SWPC was dissolved after the war, and its lending and contract powers were handed over to the RFC. At this time, the Office of Small Business (OSB) in the Department of Commerce also assumed some responsibilities that would later become characteristic duties of SBA. Its services were primarily educational. Believing that a lack of information and expertise was the main cause of small business failure, the OSB produced brochures and conducted management counseling for individual entrepreneurs.", " Congress created another wartime organization to handle small business concerns during the Korean War, this time called the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA).

The SDPA certified small businesses to the RFC when it had determined the businesses to be competent to perform the work of government contracts.", " By 1952, a move was on to abolish the RFC.

The EOL Program relaxed the credit and collateral requirements for applicants living below the poverty level in an effort to encourage new businesses that had been unable to attract financial backing, but were nevertheless sound commercial initiatives.", " SBA has grown significantly in terms of total assistance provided and its array of programs have been tailored to encourage small enterprises in all areas.

But there is still work to be done. It's an important responsibility, because if you cannot perform according to the terms of the contract, the government will not get the product or service it needs and you may find yourself in financial difficulty as well.", "Here are some tips to guide you after a government contract is awarded.", "When you receive the proposed contract, read it carefully before signing. This may look like an imposing task - some contracts may contain many pages, depending on the type of contract and complexity of what the government is buying. However, you will find that many terms and conditions are \"boilerplate,\" or standard. Once you read and understand the terms, you will be familiar with them when they appear in your next contract.", "One important feature of the contract is the identity of the office that will administer it. In most federal agencies, this is usually the same office that awarded the contract. In the Department of Defense, however, the contract is generally assigned to a special administering office. If you have any questions about the contract, contact the office of administration. Do not proceed and find out much later that you are not in compliance.", "  \tWhile federal contracts are similar to commercial contracts, they are different in some very important ways. They contain or make reference to many general contract provisions unique to the government. These provisions implement various statutory or regulatory requirements applicable solely to federal contracts, such as:", "; and", ".", "These matters are described in various parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (", "). SBA's ", " can assist you in understanding these FAR provisions.", "Government contracts provide that the government may cancel (terminate) your contract if:", "You fail to make delivery within the time specified in the contract;", "You fail to make progress so as to endanger performance of the contract, and/or;", "You fail to perform any provisions of the contract.", "Before terminating a contract for default, however, the contracting officer must give you an opportunity to remedy defects in your performance or show why your contract should not be terminated.", "  \tIf your contract is terminated for default, you are entitled only to payment at the contract's price for items accepted by the government. If the government still needs the items that you failed to deliver, it has the right to procure the same items elsewhere and, if they cost more, charge the excess costs to you. This can be a very serious and costly matter.", "  \tIf you can show that your failure to deliver or to make progress is excusable, your contract will not be terminated for default. To be excusable, a delay must be beyond your control and not caused by your fault or negligence. If your contract is terminated for default and you can prove that the government's action was improper, the termination will be treated as one for the \u201cconvenience of the government.\u201d", "  \tThe government may unilaterally terminate all or part of a contract for its convenience. Termination for convenience does not arise from any fault on the part of the contractor, but protects the government's interests by allowing it to cancel contracts for products that become obsolete or unnecessary.\u00a0", "  \tThe government must give you written notice of termination for convenience, but is not required to give advance notice. The notice of termination will usually direct you to stop work, terminate subcontracts, place no further orders, communicate similar instructions to subcontractors and suppliers, and prepare a termination settlement claim. If you fail to follow these directions, you do so at your own risk and expense. You should also receive detailed instructions as to the protection and preservation of all property that is or may become government-owned.", "  \tAfter termination for convenience, the government will make a settlement with you to compensate you fully and fairly for the work you have done and any preparation made for the terminated portion of the contract. A reasonable allowance for profit is also included.", "Because the government's needs change from time to time, government contracts contain a clause authorizing the contracting officer to unilaterally order changes in the specifications and other contract terms. The changes must be \"within the general scope of the contract.\" The contractor is obliged to perform the contract as unilaterally changed by the contracting officer. A change is within the scope of the contract if it can be regarded as within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into. The government cannot use a change order to change the general nature of the contract. The contractor is entitled to an equitable adjustment in price and delivery schedule if changes are ordered.", "The obligation to make prompt payments for products delivered or services rendered is, generally speaking, the primary obligation of the government on a procurement contract. Payment is, naturally, of utmost importance to the small business. Your contract will specify the government office responsible for payment and will contain invoicing instructions. The more accurate your invoices, the more quickly you will be paid, so it is important to understand the payment process thoroughly. Prompt payment on all contracts serves the best interest of both the contractor and the government. Under certain circumstances, if the government does not accomplish prompt payment, you can submit a request for interest payments.", "  \tUnder fixed-price contracts, the method of payment can vary with the dollar value of the contract. For relatively small contracts with a single item of work, you will generally be paid the total contract price in one lump sum. Payment is made after the government accepts delivery. For larger contracts with many items, you can invoice and receive partial payments. For example, in a contract for 120 units with a delivery rate of 10 per month, you can invoice each month for the price of delivered (and accepted) items. Larger fixed-price contracts and subcontracts where the first delivery is several months after award may contain a clause permitting you to receive progress payments based upon costs incurred as work progresses.", "  \tBecause progress payments are based on work that is not completed, you must repay them if you fail to complete the work. To protect its interest, the government takes title to your work-in-process for which progress payments have been made. To qualify for progress payments, you must have an accounting system that can accurately identify and segregate contract costs.", "The federal government has exact specifications for most of the products and services it buys on a regular basis. In all likelihood, your contract will contain such precise specifications. In fact, the specifications \u2014 which describe the government's requirements \u2014 were contained in the invitation for bids or request for proposals on which you based your bid or proposal.", "  \tOnce an award is made to your company, you are contractually bound to deliver the product or service described in the specifications. Sometimes, the basic specifications will make reference to and incorporate other Federal specifications. You are, of course, bound by the terms of these specifications as well as the basic specifications. Failure to deliver a product meeting these terms may result in termination of your contract by default.", "  \tNever bid on a contract unless you have read and understood all of the specifications. Also, read the specifications again before you start work under the contract.", "Government contracts provide that the government may inspect and test the items you deliver to determine if they conform to contract requirements and specifications. The government will not accept a contractor's product unless it passes inspection. The type and extent of inspection and testing depend largely on what is being procured.", "In addition to having a working knowledge of government contracting procedures, you should be aware of the following:", "The government conducts its business through authorized agents called contracting officers. Only a contracting officer has authority to bind the government, unless you are otherwise advised in writing. However, even contracting officers have limits on their authority, so do not hesitate to make sure of the authority of the person with whom you are dealing.", "Government procurement has historically been used as a vehicle for advancing various national, social, and economic objectives. As a government contractor, you will be required to comply with the labor standards statutes (", ", ", ", etc.) and other statutes advancing national socio-economic objectives, except for certain contracts where such legislation is specifically stated as nonapplicable.", "You should become familiar with the contract provisions protecting the integrity of the government procurement process. These provisions include the \"officials not to benefit\" clause, the \"anti-kickback\" provisions, the \"gratuities\" clause, and more.", "Disputes between you and the contracting officer may occur under the contract. Federal contracts contain a clause setting forth procedures to resolve disputes. If the contracting officer issues a decision that is not satisfactory to you, you must make a timely appeal to the Board of Contracts Appeal or the decision becomes final.", "Do not attempt to build something bigger, better, or different than called for by the contract. If you do, it may be too big or too heavy or may not fit and the government will not accept it. Simply comply with the contract terms, particularly the specifications.", "If your contract requires production, establish a production control schedule to assure that you will have the right materials in-house at the right time to meet delivery requirements. Make sure to place any subcontracts promptly and schedule delivery of subcontracted items carefully to avoid over- or under-stocking. If it appears you will not meet your schedule, notify the administration office immediately to obtain assistance. Failure to deliver on time gives the government the right to cancel your contract, with possibly disastrous results to you.", "Being e-commerce-savvy is very important in doing business with the Federal Government.
